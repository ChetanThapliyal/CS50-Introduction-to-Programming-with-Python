# CS50 Introduction to Programming with Python — Revision Repository

This repository is dedicated to revising the fundamentals of Python programming using the **CS50 Introduction to Programming with Python** course. It is organized to help reinforce key concepts, practice problem sets, and document notes throughout the course.

## Structure

The repository is organized into weekly folders, each corresponding to a major topic in the course:

- **1. Functions, Variables**
- **2. Conditionals**
- **3. Loops**
- **4. Exceptions**
- **5. Libraries**
- **6. Unit Tests**
- **7. File IO**
- **8. Regular Expressions**
- **9. Object-Oriented Programming**
- **10. the rest**
- **Final Project**

Each folder contains:
- `README.md` — Overview of the week's topic and problem set.
- `Notes.ipynb` — Jupyter notebook for lecture notes and concept summaries.
- `Problem_Set.ipynb` — Jupyter notebook for solving the weekly problem set.

## How to Use

- Open any week's folder to access notes and problem sets.
- Use Jupyter Notebook to edit and run code in `.ipynb` files.
- Refer to the README in each folder for a summary of the week's topic.

## Why This Repository?

I am using this course and repository to revise and strengthen my understanding of Python basics, including functions, conditionals, loops, exceptions, libraries, testing, file I/O, regular expressions, and object-oriented programming.

## Getting Started

To work with the notebooks:
1. Ensure you have Jupyter installed (already set up in this devcontainer).
2. Open a terminal and run `jupyter notebook` or use the Jupyter extension in VSCode.
3. Navigate to the desired week's folder and open the notebook.
